## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning solution for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The goal is to classify chest X-ray images into two categories:
- **NORMAL**: Healthy lungs
- **PNEUMONIA**: Pneumonia-affected lungs

The project explores multiple CNN architectures and compares their performance, ultimately selecting the best-performing model for pneumonia detection.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is the [Chest X-ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images) from Kaggle, downloaded using the kagglehub library.

### Dataset Structure

```

### Dataset Statistics
- **Training Set**:
  - NORMAL: 1,341 images
  - PNEUMONIA: 3,875 images
  - Total: 5,216 images

- **Test Set**:
  - NORMAL: 234 images
  - PNEUMONIA: 390 images
  - Total: 624 images

### Class Distribution
The dataset shows class imbalance with pneumonia cases being more prevalent than normal cases (~3:1 ratio in training set).

## Data Exploration

The project includes comprehensive data exploration:
- Visual inspection of random sample images from both classes
- Distribution analysis of training and test sets
- Sample visualization with proper labeling

## Data Preprocessing

### Image Transformations

#### Basic Transform (for validation/test)
```python
basic_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5], std=[0.5])
])
```

#### Augmented Transform (for training)
```python
train_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.8, 1.0)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(15),
    transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=0, translate=(0.1, 0.1)),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.2, contrast=0.2),
    transforms.RandomAdjustSharpness(sharpness_factor=2, p=0.5),
    transforms.RandomAutocontrast(p=0.3),
    transforms.RandomApply([transforms.GaussianBlur(3)], p=0.3),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5], std=[0.5])
])
```
